# Frappe-App
An app which can be used to order food 
During my undergrad, we had a long queue in the university cafeteria. We were spending a lot of time waiting for our food. So I built an app that would allow students to pre-order food and collect the food in the cafeteria rather than wait in a queue. This gained traction and had more than 100 users.
